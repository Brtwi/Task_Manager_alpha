# Task Manager (v. alpha)

Simple client-server desktop application in Java to manage own tasks and to send created tasks to another users.
Notice, this is a simple 'alpha version' project; it has its flaws and shortcomings, which I am constantly trying to make up for and improve the program.
I would appreciate any feedback on any aspect.

============================================================================================

## What it can?
You can add your own task, with description and with related files. While creating you can choose to send task (with or without file) to any online user.
When you update task data and if you sent it before to someone else, the changes will appear on every copy of that object. 

## How to start?
You can just simply download jars (Serwer and Klient), first you have to start Serwer to enable Klient's app to connect with server. Then you have to type your username, it can be any, just not one that someone has already introduced.
